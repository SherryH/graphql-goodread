For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /><br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. <br /><br />We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”<br /><br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.<br /><br />Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications <i>The Black Swan</i> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. <br /><br /><i>The Black Swan</i> is a landmark book – itself a black swan.<br /><br />The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["21559"],"name":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["132219"],"text_reviews_count":["7994"]}]}],"published":["2007"],"work":[{"id":["2157806"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.8FaHjNRMpC09kAGUsXQsHA"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"38315","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812975219"],"isbn13":["9780812975215"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1188","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ZsakuTLEBg29hs3joozFIw"],"title":["Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets"],"title_without_series":["Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness"],"num_pages":["368"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Random House Trade Paperbacks"],"publication_day":["23"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["36601"],"description":["<b><i>Fooled by Randomness </i>is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand.

For what he calls the \"antifragile\" is one step beyond robust, as it benefits from adversity, uncertainty and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.<br /><br />Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, and proposing that things be built in an antifragile manner. Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragility provides a blueprint for how to behave-and thrive-in a world we don't understand and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand. He who is not antifragile will perish. Why is the city state better than the nation state, why is debt bad for you, and why is almost everything modern bound to fail? The book covers innovation, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems.

Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.<br /><br /> As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:<br /><br /><b>• <i>For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. </i></b>You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.<br /><b>• <i>Ethical rules aren’t universal</i>.</b> You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general.<br /><b>• <i>Minorities, not majorities, run the world. </i></b>The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.<br /><b>• <i>You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot</i>.</b> “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.<br /><b>• <i>Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find)</i>.</b> A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.<br /><b>• <i>True religion is commitment, not just faith</i>.</b> How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it.<br /><br />The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["21559"],"name":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["132219"],"text_reviews_count":["7994"]}]}],"published":["2018"],"work":[{"id":["57645736"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ty-ArUdPIHFLg7zWHr9gkQ"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"204689","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0471152803"],"isbn13":["0723812152803"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"10","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.CVeGkwUeCfNbAnVTFM_ETg"],"title":["Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options"],"title_without_series":["Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204689.Dynamic_Hedging"],"num_pages":["528"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Wiley"],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["1997"],"publication_month":["1"],"average_rating":["4.02"],"ratings_count":["314"],"description":["Written by a leading options trader and derivatives risk advisor to global banks and exchanges, this book provides a practical, real-world methodology for monitoring and managing all the risks associated with portfolio management.

What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. What is crucial is that the antifragile loves errors, as it incurs small harm and large benefits from them.

Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? <i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is about luck: more precisely, about how we perceive luck in our personal and professional experiences. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill—the markets—<i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is an irreverent, eye-opening, and endlessly entertaining exploration of one of the least understood forces in our lives.<br />  <br /><b>THE BED OF PROCRUSTES</b><br /><b> </b><br /><b>“Taleb’s crystalline nuggets of thought stand alone like esoteric poems.”—<i>Financial Times</i></b><br />  <br /> This collection of aphorisms and meditations expresses Taleb’s major ideas in ways you least expect. <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i> takes its title from Greek mythology: the story of a man who made his visitors fit his bed to perfection by either stretching them or cutting their limbs. With a rare combination of pointed wit and potent wisdom, Taleb plows through human illusions, contrasting the classical views of courage, elegance, and erudition against the modern diseases of nerdiness, philistinism, and phoniness."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["21559"],"name":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["132219"],"text_reviews_count":["7994"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["48207780"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Bvv6X-OdYPqxAvoI75FBkQ"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"29570669","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"0","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tjDFOdcyXnvYiieOHV5NZA"],"title":["Silent Risk"],"title_without_series":["Silent Risk"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29570669-silent-risk"],"num_pages":["436"],"format":["ebook"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Descartes"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.30"],"ratings_count":["10"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["21559"],"name":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["132219"],"text_reviews_count":["7994"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["49898957"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.JS7jF-RdMvxr8oO1pkxgqA"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"26215132","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"0","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.p29umUODSlMWuw9UKP225g"],"title":["Robustezza e fragilità"],"title_without_series":["Robustezza e fragilità"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26215132-robustezza-e-fragilit"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.50"],"ratings_count":["18"],"description":["Tre anni dopo la pubblicazione del \"Cigno nero\", un \"racconto filosofico\" acclamato in tutto il mondo, Nassim Nicholas Taleb fa il bilancio della vita del suo libro. L'idea talebiana del Cigno nero ha conquistato milioni di lettori e fecondato la ricerca in campi molto diversi, dalla filosofia alla statistica, dalla sociologia alla psicologia, agli studi sul clima, alla medicina. Meno feconda questa idea si è rivelata invece in economia, l'area più immediatamente vicina agli interessi dell'autore. Sulla crisi del 2008, e sugli economisti che dovrebbero analizzarla e curarla, Taleb si sofferma in questo nuovo libro, con annotazioni che hanno il sapore dell'ironia e dello scetticismo. E, ancora una volta, ribalta i sedicenti \"esperti di rischi\" che in questi tre anni hanno risposto all'autore con ostilità, dimostrando la loro inguaribile cecità ai Cigni neri. \"Robustezza e fragilità\" riassume tre anni di vita di un'idea forte, in grado di modificare i nostri paradigmi mentali; tre anni che hanno anche trasformato, in meglio, la vita dell'autore. Taleb ha incontrato filosofi, scrittori, scienziati, uomini di stato, lettori comuni e persino buoni economisti, si è confrontato con loro, ne ha ascoltato conferme e obiezioni, ha visto crescere e svilupparsi la sua idea nel mondo. Da questi incontri è nato \"Robustezza e fragilità\", il suo nuovo racconto filosofico dove, fornendoci una carta topografica dell'Estremistan, Taleb ci insegna come muoverci in un mondo dominato dal caso e dall'incertezza."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["21559"],"name":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["132219"],"text_reviews_count":["7994"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["46196480"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.UfjVEzxxoJxd-m0Q6IVYpg"]}]}]
